### Workspaces

* See your Keyboard shortcuts for moving windows to another workspace.
* Configure the Ubuntu Dock to show windows only from the current workspace:
 * run `gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock isolate-workspaces true`

## Issues

* Frozen:
  * single programm, mouse: https://askubuntu.com/a/4412
  * everything: https://askubuntu.com/a/36717 While holding `Alt` and the `SysReq (Print Screen)` keys, type slowly `REISUB`. Let a few seconds pass in between each keypress.
